## Introduction

The Lenna (or Lena) picture is one of the most widely used standard test images used for compression algorithms.  The <a target="_top" href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/compression-faq/part1/"> comp.compression FAQ </a> says the following:<p>

</p><ul>
For the curious: 'lena' or 'lenna' is a digitized Playboy centerfold,
from November 1972. (Lenna is the spelling in Playboy, Lena is the
Swedish spelling of the name.) Lena Soderberg (ne Sjööblom) was last
reported living in her native Sweden, happily married with three kids
and a job with the state liquor monopoly.  In 1988, she was
interviewed by some Swedish computer related publication, and she was
pleasantly amused by what had happened to her picture.  That was the
first she knew of the use of that picture in the computer business.

For the full details on the history of this image check out this excellent <a href="pcs_mirror/may_june01.pdf">May 2001</a> article in the Newsletter of the IEEE Professional Communication Society by Jamie Hutchinson.  Here's an excerpt:

</p><ul>

Alexander Sawchuk estimates that it was in June or July of 1973 when
he, then an assistant professor of electrical engineering at the USC
Signal and Image Processing Institute (SIPI), along with a graduate
student and the SIPI lab manager, was hurriedly searching the lab for
a good image to scan for a colleague's conference paper. They had tired
of their stock of usual test images, dull stuff dating back to
television standards work in the early 1960s. They wanted something
glossy to ensure good output dynamic range, and they wanted a human
face. Just then, somebody happened to walk in with a recent issue of
Playboy.

<p>

The engineers tore away the top third of the centerfold so they could
wrap it around the drum of their Muirhead wirephoto scanner, which
they had outfitted with analog-to-digital converters (one each for the
red, green, and blue channels) and a Hewlett Packard 2100
minicomputer. The Muirhead had a fixed resolution of 100 lines per
inch and the engineers wanted a 512 x 512 image, so they limited
the scan to the top 5.12 inches of the picture, effectively cropping it
at the subject's shoulders.

</p></ul>

<p>

The original image is still available as part of the 
<a href="http://sipi.usc.edu/services/database/Database.html">USC SIPI Image Database</a>
in their "<a href="http://sipi.usc.edu/services/database/database.cgi?volume=misc">miscellaneous</a>" collection.

</p><p>

Over the years there has been quite a bit of controversy over the use of
this image.  Some people proposed banning the use of this image because of its
source.  Also, Playboy threatened to prosecute the unauthorized use of
the image.  
Check out an editorial
by the editor of SPIE journal <a target="_top" href="optical.html"><i>Optical Engineering</i></a>.
Check out a note
by the former editor-in-chief of the <a target="_top" href="editor.html"><i>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</i></a>.  
According to <a target="_top" href="wired_backups/4000.html"><i>Wired Magazine</i></a>, Playboy has eased up in its pursuit of the copyright violators of this image.

</p><p>

Another interesting piece of trivia is that Lenna's issue (November 1972)
was Playboy's <a href="http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/faq/what.html#4">best selling issue ever</a> and sold 7,161,561 copies.

<h2>The Rest of the Story</h2><p>

Very few people have seen the complete original picture.  A number of years ago when I was working on compression algorithms, a colleague of mine obtained a copy of the original Playboy Magazine.  I scanned it in and here's a glimpse:</p><p>
